# Console-Finances
## Title
Simple application that analyzes the financial records of a company using Javascript.

### User Story
```
As a Developer, I want to write a code that will analyse the finanical records of a company
so that I can calculate the required data as follows:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset.
2. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
(Total/Number of months)
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
It is done when you open the console in the browser. resulting analysis looks similar to following:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 25
Total: $2561231
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
